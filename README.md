Backend Exam
 Task Description:
 You are developing a banking system application that follows the clean architecture principles.
 The system contains the following three layers: Domain, Use Case, and Infrastructure.
 The Domain layer consists of the entities representing domain concepts such as Account,
 Transaction, and Customer. These entities have methods for performing specific operations
 related to their respective domains.
 The Use Case layer contains the business logic of the application. It includes use cases like
 creating a new account, making a transaction, and generating account statements.
 The Infrastructure layer deals with the interaction between the application and the outside
 world. It includes repositories for persisting data, external service integrations, and data access
 objects.
 Your task is to implement a simplified version of the banking system application based on clean
 architecture. You need to create the necessary classes and methods following the clean
 architecture principles.
 Requirements:
 1. Implement the Account entity class with the following attributes: account_id,
 customer_id, account_number, balance.
 a. It should have the following methods: deposit(), withdraw(), and get_balance().
 2. Implement the Customer entity class with the following attributes: customer_id, name,
 email, and phone_number.
 3. Implement a Use Case class for creating a new account. It should have a method named
 create_account() that takes customer_id, name, email, and phone_number as input and
 returns an Account object.
 4. Implement a Use Case class for making a transaction. It should have a method named
 make_transaction() that takes account_id, amount, and transaction_type (either
 'deposit' or 'withdraw') as input and updates the account balance accordingly.
 5. Implement a Use Case class for generating account statements. It should have a method
 named generate_account_statement() that takes account_id as input and returns a
 statement string containing transaction details for the given account.
 6. Implement an Infrastructure class named AccountRepository for persisting and
 retrieving account data. It should have methods like save_account(),
 find_account_by_id(), and find_accounts_by_customer_id().
 7. Implement a simple test scenario that demonstrates the use of all the implemented
 classes and methods.
Notes:
 ● Youdon'tneedtoimplement any specific data storage mechanisms. Just focus on the
 class design and method implementations as per clean architecture principles.
 ● Youcanassumetheavailability of any required external libraries or modules.
 ● Youshouldprovide the complete implementation for the problem, including the
 necessary classes and methods.
